## Code of Conduct

Code of Conduct ADempiere Since its inception, the ADempiere project has attracted many people to join your community. The vision of our project is "to inspire people to share". This theme is central to the way the ADempiere community collaborates. ADempiere members of the community need to work together effectively, and a code of conduct lays down the "ground rules" for our cooperation.

Our motto perfectly captures the spirit of sharing and cooperation that is at the core of the open source movement. In the Free Software world, we collaborate freely on a volunteer basis to build software for everyone's benefit. We improve the work of others, which we have received for free, andthen share our improvements on the same basis.

This collaboration depends on good relationships between developers. To this end, we have agreed on the following code of conduct to help define the waysthat we think collaboration and cooperation should be made.
